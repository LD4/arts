  <strong>Update (October 2025)</strong><br>
  The LD4 Art & Design Affinity Group is now the LD4 Arts Affinity Group! This name change reflects the broadened scope of our group, which in additional to visual arts and design will also now officially encompass the use of linked data related to performing arts (dance, music, theatre), time-based media (film, sound recordings), and any other art form that piques our group's interest. We will work on updating our website to reflect this change in the coming weeks.
</div>

We aim to advance the use of linked data for art and design from a library- and archives-led perspective through information sharing, exchange, and collaboration.

As an [LD4 Affinity Group](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/ld4-community-site/groups), we are open to all, regardless of institutional or organizational affiliation.

# Scope
We are a community of practice that explores the unique challenges of modeling, creating, querying, and visualizing linked data related to art and design including:
- Domains such as visual arts, performance art, craft, architecture, graphic design, and fashion
- Events such as exhibitions, performances, and auctions
- Formats such as catalogs, artists' books, visual resource collections, and artist files

# Background

An earlier version of the LD4 Art & Design Affinity Group organized calls between June 2021â€“January 2023 under the name "ARLIS/NA Wikidata Group." We began meeting regularly following sessions at the 2021 [ARLIS/NA](https://www.arlisna.org/) conference including a [Wikidata workshop](https://sched.co/inVJ) and [Digital Humanities SIG meeting](https://sched.co/inYe) on Wiki projects in art and architecture libraries. Members also organized a session for the 2022 ARLIS/NA conference titled "[Points of Connection: Using Wikidata for Art Information](https://sched.co/uwUn)."

In February 2023, we joined the [LD4](https://ld4.io/) community as an affinity group, updating our name and expanding our scope to linked data more broadly.

# Calls
We hold monthly open calls to learn about and discuss projects, resources, and tools within our scope. Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/ld4-art-design) to be notified when calls are announced.
