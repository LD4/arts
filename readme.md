We aim to advance the use of linked data for art and design from a library- and archives-led perspective through information sharing, exchange, and collaboration.

As an [LD4 Affinity Group](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/ld4-community-site/groups), we are open to all, regardless of institutional or organizational affiliation.

# Scope
We are a community of practice that explores the unique challenges of modeling, creating, querying, and visualizing linked data related to art and design including:
- Domains such as visual arts, performance art, craft, architecture, graphic design, and fashion
- Events such as exhibitions, performances, and auctions
- Formats such as catalogs, artists' books, visual resource collections, and artist files

# Background

An earlier version of the LD4 Art & Design Affinity Group organized calls between June 2021–January 2023 under the name "ARLIS/NA Wikidata Group." We began meeting regularly following sessions at the 2021 [ARLIS/NA](https://www.arlisna.org/) conference including a [Wikidata workshop](https://sched.co/inVJ) and [Digital Humanities SIG meeting](https://sched.co/inYe) on Wiki projects in art and architecture libraries. Members also organized a session for the 2022 ARLIS/NA conference titled "[Points of Connection: Using Wikidata for Art Information](https://sched.co/uwUn)."

In February 2023, we joined the [LD4](https://ld4.io/) community as an affinity group, updating our name and expanding our scope to linked data more broadly.

# Calls
We hold monthly open calls to learn about and discuss projects, resources, and tools within our scope. Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/ld4-art-design) to be notified when calls are announced.
